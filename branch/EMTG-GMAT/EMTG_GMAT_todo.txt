* Features that "should (i.e marginally tested)" be working as of 2014_08_01:
* - multiphase
* - multijourney (single-phase)
* - objective function (maximize final mass)
* - departures( launch direct-departure, free departure)
* - arrivals ( low-thrust rendezvous)
* - engine models (fixed isp / fixed thrust)
* - launch window and journey wait times enforced
* - bounded mission TOF enforced
* - bound journey TOF enforced
* - variable phase TOF
* - variable flyby position and velocity with bounds enabled


* Features that need to be implemented into the SRC in the near future (2014_08_01)
- all objective functions
- journey arrival date and journey aggregate elapsed time bound 'journey_time_bounded' == 3 is aggregate case.  
- all departure and arrival conditions (except spiral).
- boundary types such that we can start/end at a fixed point in space or specified (partially) COE/Inertial "phase.frame.rotate(ICRF, local) ..."
- depart / insert to a parking orbit (EMTG only encodes sma and ecc). can have varied or fixed elements.
- pre and post coasts (coasts start after phase epochs) [for launches and flybys]
- minimum dry mass constraint
- propellant mass constraint
- propellant, power, launch_vehicle margin
- launch vehicle C3 curves
- variable initial mass
- journey mass increment/decrement
- (TBD) zero-turn flyby (for some bodies); 
- SRP on and all planets for SRP 
- Option for scaling constraints {solve first with scaled and then resolved with unscaled}
- method for reseeding GMAT
- A Post-process GMAT optimization to propagate the final result and show Views (aka figures)
- hooks for GMAT electric and nuclear power models, as well as electric thruster models


* Features that need to be implemented into the GUI in the near future (2014_08_01) 
- check box for debug file 
- selection of the user's optimizer of choice
