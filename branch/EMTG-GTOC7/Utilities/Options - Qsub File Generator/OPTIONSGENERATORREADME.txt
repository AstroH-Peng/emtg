This program will automatically generate emtg options files and their corresponding qsub script for cluster runs (Taub and Blue Waters).

The program will prompt you for information, primarily concerning qsub generation.

The options file fields that are changed are starting asteroid and launch window opening epoch, all others are assumed to be constant and must be set manually inside LRTS_model.emtgopt

Be sure to set the Universe folder location and asteroid list name correctly in the options file.
